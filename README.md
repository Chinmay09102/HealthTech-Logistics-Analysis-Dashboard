# HealthTech-Logistics-Insights-Dashboard:
Performed comprehensive data cleansing and transformation on a large-scale dataset containing 10K+ medical equipment records using SQL. The initiative involved refining and structuring the data to ensure accuracy and consistency.

Developed impactful visualizations focusing on five key performance indicators (KPIs). The visualizations provided insightful analyses of revenue trends, freight costs, and country-wise distribution of equipment suppliers and purchasers.

This project encompassed a thorough examination of various columns within the dataset, extracting meaningful insights to inform strategic decision-making. The goal was to enhance data quality, derive actionable metrics, and facilitate a deeper understanding of the medical equipment logistics landscape.
